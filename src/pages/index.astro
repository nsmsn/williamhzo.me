      <h3>Crafting user-focused interfaces</h3>

      <p>
        I strongly believe in under-engineering: using the <em>right</em> tools for
        the job, I design and build the best possible experience, regardless of end
        user's device, network quality or disability â€” with <em
          >progressive enhancement</em
        > as a baseline.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Leveraging fluid and global CSS to let the browser do its work rather
          than over-specifying rules and breakpoints to apply to each element.
        </li>

        <li>
          Shipping as little client-side JavaScript as possible: content-focused
          websites that don't require complex client-side interactivity should
          mainly ship HTML to the client, not a bloated JS framework.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The tools I use</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>For most projects: TypeScript and CSS</li>
        <li>For static, content-focused websites: Astro or Eleventy</li>
        <li>
          For dynamic and snappy Single Page Apps: React & Next.js, or Svelte &
          SvelteKit
        </li>
        <li>Currently learning: GSAP and SvelteKit</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Things I can do for you</h3>

      <ul role="list">
        <li>
          build an optimized custom landing page, for marketing or personal
          branding
        </li>
        <li>
          create or maintain your design system (includes design tokens,
          component libraries, setting up a testing environment like Storybook)
        </li>
        <li>build dynamic SPAs (like onboarding funnels, dashboards, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
